# Machine-Learning-in-Python
Introduces the processes of exploring, visualizing, and classifying large amounts of data.
This course provides an introduction to classic and contemporary learning techniques in classification and regression, 
using the Python programming language for simple APIs and rapid prototyping.
We explore linear classification algorithms and their non-linear counterparts via kernel tricks.
We also explore Neural Networks and deep learning architectures, with emphasis on GPU accelerated training and auto encoding procedures. 
Class projects focus on using Kaggle competitions as example datasets. 
All material covered will be reinforced through hands-on experience using state-of-the art tools to design and execute data learning algorithms.
