Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the world, our lifestyle has changed. Staying at home, stockpiling food, and practicing social distancing has become normal methods to prevent the spread of coronavirus. However, there are still many people who are worried about their conditions if they have a fever, sore throat, or muscle pain. Therefore, in this project, we would like to investigate several common features of COVID-19 based on the data from common physical exams. Then we rely on clinical diagnostic data to make a deeper understanding of why these symptoms happen, what body physiological indices actually have changed, and how have they changed. This research probably helps broaden our horizons so that we may have more efficient ways to prevent this disease.
